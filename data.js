            '* All patients with a hip fracture, femoral shaft fracture and peri-prosthetic hip fracture should be admitted to orthopaedic/orthogeriatric ward by within 4 hours of presentation \n' +
            '* All patients with a hip and femoral shaft fracture who are medically fit should have surgery where necessary within 36 hours, and during normal working hours (9-5, 7 days a week).\n' +
            '* All patients with a hip fracture, femoral shaft fracture and peri-prosthetic hip fracture should be assessed and cared for with a view to minimising their risk of developing a pressure ulcer. \n' +
            '* All patients a hip fracture, femoral shaft fracture and peri-prosthetic hip fracture should have cognition assessed and be monitored for delirium. \n' +
            '* All patients presenting with a hip fracture, femoral shaft fracture and peri-prosthetic hip fracture should be assessed to determine their need for anti-resorptive therapy to prevent future osteoporotic fractures. \n' +
            '* All patients with a hip fracture, femoral shaft fracture and peri-prosthetic hip fracture following a fall should be offered multidisciplinary assessment and intervention to prevent future falls. \n\n' +
            'These standards are set out by the British Orthopaedic Association (BOA) and the British Geriatric Society (BGS) in the publication **The Care of Patients with Fragility Fracture. 2007** and in **The Care of the older or Frail orthopaedic trauma patient 2019**.These standards are monitored for every patient admitted to St Richards Hospital with hip fracture as part of the **National Hip Fracture Database (NHFD)**. New and updated guidelines are frequently issued by the NHFD. \n\n' +
            '**The Best Practice Tariff** came into effect from April 2010, meeting the commitment to High Quality Care for All, Lord Darzi’s NHS Next Stage Review report. This financial incentive to improve standards of care is monitored through the National Hip Fracture Database. It allows Trusts to receive an additional payment (currently £1335) for each patient receiving best practice care. **The BPT indicators for hip fracture are:** \n\n' +
            '* Admission under the joint care of consultant orthogeriatrician and orthopaedic surgeon \n' +
            '* Admitted using a protocol agreed by geriatric medicine, orthopaedic surgery and anaesthetic departments \n' +
            '* Surgery within 36 hours of admission \n' +
            '* Peri-operative assessment (within 72 hours) by orthogeriatrics (ST3+/equivalent grade or above) \n' +
            '* Post-operative care by geriatrican-led multi-disciplinary team \n' +
            '* Fracture prevention assessments (falls and bone health) \n' +
            '* Pre-operative AMTS and post-operative assessment of Delirium using 4AT \n\n' +
