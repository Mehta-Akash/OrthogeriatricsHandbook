            '* All patients with a hip fracture, femoral shaft fracture and peri-prosthetic hip fracture should be admitted to orthopaedic/orthogeriatric ward by within 4 hours of presentation \n' +
            '* All patients with a hip and femoral shaft fracture who are medically fit should have surgery where necessary within 36 hours, and during normal working hours (9-5, 7 days a week).\n' +
            '* All patients with a hip fracture, femoral shaft fracture and peri-prosthetic hip fracture should be assessed and cared for with a view to minimising their risk of developing a pressure ulcer. \n' +
            '* All patients a hip fracture, femoral shaft fracture and peri-prosthetic hip fracture should have cognition assessed and be monitored for delirium. \n' +
            '* All patients presenting with a hip fracture, femoral shaft fracture and peri-prosthetic hip fracture should be assessed to determine their need for anti-resorptive therapy to prevent future osteoporotic fractures. \n' +
            '* All patients with a hip fracture, femoral shaft fracture and peri-prosthetic hip fracture following a fall should be offered multidisciplinary assessment and intervention to prevent future falls. \n\n' +
            'These standards are set out by the British Orthopaedic Association (BOA) and the British Geriatric Society (BGS) in the publication **The Care of Patients with Fragility Fracture. 2007** and in **The Care of the older or Frail orthopaedic trauma patient 2019**.These standards are monitored for every patient admitted to St Richards Hospital with hip fracture as part of the **National Hip Fracture Database (NHFD)**. New and updated guidelines are frequently issued by the NHFD. \n\n' +
            '**The Best Practice Tariff** came into effect from April 2010, meeting the commitment to High Quality Care for All, Lord Darzi’s NHS Next Stage Review report. This financial incentive to improve standards of care is monitored through the National Hip Fracture Database. It allows Trusts to receive an additional payment (currently £1335) for each patient receiving best practice care. **The BPT indicators for hip fracture are:** \n\n' +

            '*** \n\n' +
            'Middleton Ward is a 27 bedded ward on the first floor of St Richards Hospital. The medical team consists of two consultants, 1 SpR,3 juniors doctors. \n\n' +
            'Patients are generally aged = >60 years and will either be orthogeriatric (fractured NOF, femoral shaft fracture and peri-prosthetic hip fracture) patients or geriatric patients (with a range of general medical issues). \n\n' +
            'Middleton Team also cover any medical patients on the surgical ward (Wittering) next door. \n\n' +
            '## Ward Round Preparations \n\n' +
            '*** \n\n' +
            'In order to prepare for ward round, it works best for one member of the juniors to come in half an hour early each day: \n\n' +
            '1. Take note of new and day 1 post-op patients on whiteboard outside office (one inside doesn’t get updated as accurately.)\n' +
            '2. Call Wittering Ward (ext. 35251) to ask if there are any “new medical patients”\n' +
            '3. Update list based on whiteboard \n' +
            '4. Add brief background information for any new patients (e.g brief PMH, social history) \n' +
            '5. Print “patient track” reports (via WSHT applications -> Patient Track reports -> ward round) NB Wittering will print the proformas for our medical pts there and leave on the desk for us. \n\n' +
            'There will generally be one consultant covering orthogeriatrics and one covering the medical patients on Middleton/Wittering (see above table) \n\n' +
            'On Monday/Wednesday/Thursday, the orthogeriatric consultant will see any patients who are new/ day 1 post-op/ we are concerned about, then the rest of the patients are seen by the junior team with SpR support where available. \n\n' +
            'On junior WR days, it is helpful for each junior to see the same bays of patients, as this adds some consistency and familiarity with the patients which makes the ward round more efficient and hopefully more comfortable for the patients. \n\n' +
